## 🎯 Project Vision

> "Transform complex AI task collaboration into an epic journey like Journey to the West: Wukong solves problems, Bajie audits quality, Wujing delivers results, and the White Horse remembers everything."

**Westodyssey** is an innovative AI collaboration framework inspired by the classic Chinese novel **Journey to the West**. It organizes four specialized AI agents into an efficient team that handles complex tasks through coordinated roles.

## 📖 Journey to the West Background (For International Audience)

### The Classic Story
**Journey to the West** (西游记) is one of the Four Great Classical Novels of Chinese literature, written in the 16th century during the Ming dynasty. It recounts the legendary pilgrimage of the Buddhist monk **Tang Sanzang** (唐僧) who travels from China to India to obtain sacred Buddhist texts.

### The Iconic Team
The story features a diverse team with complementary skills that inspired our AI framework:

| Character | Chinese Name | Role | Modern AI Interpretation |
|-----------|--------------|------|--------------------------|
| **Sun Wukong** | 孙悟空 | The Monkey King | Core problem solver, code expert |
| **Zhu Bajie** | 猪八戒 | The Pig Monk | Quality auditor, risk manager |
| **Sha Wujing** | 沙悟净 | The Sand Monk | Data formatter, deliverer |
| **White Dragon Horse** | 白龙马 | The Steed | Knowledge base, memory system |
| **Tang Sanzang** | 唐僧 | The Master | Human user, mission guide |

### Why This Story Inspires Modern AI
1. **Team Diversity**: Each character has unique strengths that complement others
2. **Role Specialization**: Clear division of labor based on expertise
3. **Mentor Guidance**: Human oversight directing the AI team
4. **Journey Metaphor**: Complex tasks as epic journeys with growth

We've reimagined this 500-year-old story for the age of AI, creating a framework where digital "disciples" collaborate like the classic literary team.

## 👥 The Westodyssey Team

| Disciple | Role | Responsibilities | Key Traits |
|----------|------|------------------|------------|
| 🐒 **Wukong** | Core Problem Solver | Task decomposition, code writing, data collection | Most capable, execution expert |
| 🐷 **Bajie** | Chief Audit Officer | Code review, security audit, quality assurance | Extremely挑剔, quality guardian |
| 🐢 **Wujing** | Data Delivery Officer | Data cleaning, formatting, final delivery | Strict规范, zero-error output |
| 🐎 **White Horse** | Memory Foundation | Historical recording, knowledge retrieval, experience传承 | Records但不推理, knowledge库 |

## ✨ Core Features

### 🎭 Four-Role AI Collaboration
- **Wukong**: Handles the most complex coding and data analysis tasks
- **Bajie**: Ensures all outputs pass strict security and quality reviews  
- **Wujing**: Formats results into professional, standardized outputs
- **White Horse**: Records all history and provides knowledge support

### 🔒 Three-Level Security Review
1. **Wukong Self-Check**: Code logic and functionality verification
2. **Bajie Audit**: Security, efficiency, and best practices review
3. **Wujing Validation**: Output format and specification verification

### 📚 Continuous Knowledge Accumulation
- All task history automatically recorded to knowledge base
- Intelligent retrieval based on RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
- Team experience continuously accumulates and optimizes

### 🔄 Standardized Workflow

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- OpenAI API key (or other compatible LLM API)

### Basic Installation
```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/SynSwarm/WestOdyssey.git
cd WestOdyssey

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Configure API key
echo "OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here" > .env
```

### Your First Mission
```python
from westodyssey import TangSeng

# Create TangSeng instance (user proxy)
ts = TangSeng()

# Assign a mission
result = ts.assign_mission(
    mission="Analyze current GitHub trending projects and create a Markdown report",
    context="Should include project description, tech stack, stars trend, etc."
)

print(result)
```
