# ❓ Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

## 🏮 General Questions

### What is Westodyssey?
Westodyssey is an innovative AI collaboration framework inspired by the classic Chinese novel **Journey to the West**. It organizes AI agents into specialized roles (Wukong, Bajie, Wujing, White Horse) to handle complex tasks through coordinated teamwork.

### Why the Journey to the West theme?
The novel features a diverse team with complementary skills - exactly what we need for effective AI collaboration. Each character represents a different aspect of problem-solving that translates well to AI agent design.

### Is this just for Chinese developers?
Not at all! While inspired by Chinese literature, the framework is designed for global developers. We provide bilingual documentation and the concepts are universally applicable to AI collaboration challenges.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### What are the prerequisites?
- Python 3.8 or higher

### Is there a quick start guide?
Yes! Check out our [Quick Start Guide](./getting-started.md) for a step-by-step introduction.

## 🤖 Technical Questions

### How do the four disciples work together?
1. **Wukong** - Creative problem solver, handles complex challenges
2. **Bajie** - Quality auditor, ensures output meets standards  
3. **Wujing** - Data deliverer, formats and presents results
4. **White Horse** - Memory keeper, maintains context and learning

### Can I customize the agents?
Absolutely! Each agent is configurable. You can adjust their parameters, add custom tools, or even create entirely new agent types.

### What AI models does Westodyssey support?
The framework is model-agnostic. We provide integrations with popular models (OpenAI, Anthropic, local models) but you can plug in any model you prefer.

### Is there a web interface?
Not yet, but it's on our roadmap. Currently, Westodyssey is a Python library that you can integrate into your applications.
